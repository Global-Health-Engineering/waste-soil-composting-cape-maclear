# Farmer survey

## Background

This directory contains two surveys conducted with the farmers of Cape Maclear, Malawi. In between them, the farmers, accompanied by Raphael Meier, visited the composting facility in Lilongwe, Malawi.

The goal of the first survey (`farmers-questionnaire-1.csv`) was to gain insights and better understanding of current agricultural practices, existing knowledge on compost, fertilizers, and the use of them from farmers.

The goal of the second survey (`farmers-questionnaire-2.csv`) was to assess whether there was a shift in farmers\' perspectives regarding composting, compost production, and usage after the visit of the composting facility, as well as how they experienced the visit.
