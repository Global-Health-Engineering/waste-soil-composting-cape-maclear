Why did you do it?,,I didn't want to plant tomato because I didn't have fertilizer.,,,,,"I went to Lilongwe to care for my sick brother, and the family didn't plant crops for 2 years then",,,
Why didn't you do it?,Land is limited,,This is our only land.,I don’t fallow because it will cause famine at my house. I don't have enough land,We only have this field,We don't have anywhere else to farm: land is limited,,"We only have this land. If we can farm, then we have nothing ",We don't have enough land. You can only do that when you have another field,We don't have any other field 
Where do you primarily seek information about agricultural practices?,Agriculture department and sustainable Cape maclear,Friends,"Radio, agricultural extension workers",Radio,Friends,Radio,Radio,"Radio programs - and they give out contacts of people to reach out, but has never called",Friends,I don't seek information
What do you think about the soil quality / health of your soils?,Good,Good,Poor,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Moderate,Moderate,Good,Moderate
On which criteria do you decide that? Why do you think so?,The plants/crops are sprouting (coming up) strongly ,Tomato grows well if fertilizer is applied,"It's more sandy so it doesn't retain water. Also, on one part which  plants do grow strong, Health and fast. He thinks the field is sand on one part, the other is more clay and loam",Soil porosity is very good so roots are able to penetrate. The soil also retains water that I'm able to grow plants after maize harvest (time of no rain),We can see that the maize is health and green. The taste of the maize is very good and of good aroma,All crops do well in this so.,Some part maize grow well. Some part maize grow poorly. ,It still needs fertilizer. In the last my patents were planting without fertilizer though,When there is rain maize do well. ,It's hugely dependent on fertilizer and maize stalks.  You can get yield without fertilizer 
Have you ever attended any workshops / trainings about soil quality / health?,No,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,No
Who organized the event?,,,,JICA,,,VAC. Don't know acynomy. It was an organisation support in agriculture and sex workers,,,
What was the focus of the course?,,,,"How to improve soil. How to take out bad nutrients (acidity) in the soil. To do this, we put ash in the soil. I also learn about bio-char making.",,,Planting of maize. Fertilizer application. Told to apply fertilizer when planting maize. Told to apply fertilizer in the amount of Coca-Cola bottle top. Fertilizer to be applied 4 or 5 cm from the planting seeds. I plant seeds 15 cm apart.,,,
Would you like to learn more about soil quality / health?,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
What would you like to learn?,They want learn how to make fertilizer from manure,I want to be an expert in irrigation. I like irrigation because once you have fertilizer and pesticides you move out of poverty ,Wants to learn how to improve soil fertility. Wants to learn about manure and compost production ,Soil quality. Plant management from panting to harvesting. How to improve soil or make soil fertile or health.,How to make organic fertilizer. ,Soil improvement. Crops suitability on different land,Soil improvement. Soil quality - what to know which type of crops would do be in which soil,Learn about maize farming because I feel we are not good at it. I'm saying this because we don't get enough yield. I think we can be getting 20 bags if we learn about maize farming.,Which crops are suitable for which soils. ,What type of crops do well on which type of soils. Fertilizer application - we want to know if we apply less or more
What do you think about worms - are they important for the soils health?,Maybe,Don't know,Don't know,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Don't know,Maybe,Don't know
Why do you think so?,Thinks some will fertility and some will negatively impact the soil. ,,,It penetrates soil thereby loosening it which is good for root growth and nutrient absorption ,It creates space in soil which is good for aeration ,I heard that worms should be mixed with manure to have good fertilizer. I heard this on the radio.,Sometimes we think that worms negatively affect maize. ,,"Sometimes when we plant crops, we see many of them and still maize grow just fine",
Do you use any kind of (inorganic / organic) fertilizer?,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes
Why don't you use it?,,,,"I had enough maize stalks which provides nutrients to soil if managed properly. I placed maize stalks between ridges, and build/buried the maize stalks on new ridges..",,,,,,
What types of fertilizer do you use?,"Inorganic (NPK-fertilizer / CAN / Urea),Organic (e.g Compost)","Inorganic (NPK-fertilizer / CAN / Urea),Organic (e.g Compost)","Inorganic (NPK-fertilizer / CAN / Urea),Organic (e.g Compost)",,"Inorganic (NPK-fertilizer / CAN / Urea),Organic (e.g Compost)","Inorganic (NPK-fertilizer / CAN / Urea),Organic (e.g Compost)",Inorganic (NPK-fertilizer / CAN / Urea),Inorganic (NPK-fertilizer / CAN / Urea),"Inorganic (NPK-fertilizer / CAN / Urea),Organic (e.g Compost)",Inorganic (NPK-fertilizer / CAN / Urea)
What type of inorganic fertilizer do you use?,"NPK-fertilizer,CAN - fertilizer","NPK-fertilizer,CAN - fertilizer","NPK-fertilizer,CAN - fertilizer,Urea",,"NPK-fertilizer,Urea","NPK-fertilizer,Urea",NPK-fertilizer,"NPK-fertilizer,Urea","NPK-fertilizer,Urea","NPK-fertilizer,Urea"
How do you decide which type of inorganic fertilizer to use and when?,They look at the health of the plants and size of the plant. When the plants are about to produce fruits they apply CAN,Use NPK to make the plants grow health. Used NPK after moving the tomato from nursery. Use CAN once the plants want to start producing fruits. Heard from people and friends to use it this way,I use NPk soon after the maize germinate for the maize to grow strong. I use Urea when the maize is about to produce fruits. I use CAN when urea is not available. They don't like CAN because it takes a short time for nutrients to deplete from the soil. We heard from agricultural extension workers about which fertilizer to apply. ,,"When we look at maize at some point it stops growing , so to get it growing we use NPK to facilitate it's growth. I learnt this from school and parents that NPK is good for maize growth. We use Urea when we see that the maize is about to produce fruits. We know that Urea is good for maize fruit growth",Availability of fertilizer. Can is very difficult to find here. Last time I used was like 9 years ago on a different field. I got it in Mangochi then. One week after planting I apply NPK. We just think that it's good to apply NPK fertilizer. We can't apply Urea after planting because it's too strong that it wilt the maize. I apply urea after 3 weeks. Urea start working after 21 days so that’s the time the maize start producing fruits. ,"We heard on the radio that NPK helps crops to grow well, and Urea helps crops to produce healthy fruits. Because of poor soil, we now apply NPK which was not the case in the past when soil was good",Availability od fertilizer. CAN is very difficult to find but it's good. When maize has 3 or 4 leaves we apply fertilizer. Urea is applied when the maize haa started producing tassels. We heard and hear this on the radio,Availability: It's very hard to find CAN so we use NPK instead. We hear on the radio that NPK is for plant growth. We also hear that urea is for health and strong fruits.,Quantity of fertilizer. A 50 kg bag of CAN has less volume so is not usually inadequate. Availability of fertilizer - Sometimes NPK is not available so the use urea for basal and top dressing 
How do you determine the quantity of inorganic fertilizer to apply in the field?,They apply at tea spoon for each plant ,They look at the size of the field. He also learn and observe from people doing this type of farming. ,It depends on the availability of fertilizer they have. When they have more fertilizer they put more. When fertilizer is more we use a table spoon. When fertilizer is less we use a tea spoon. We were told by agricultural extension workers again. It also depends on sowing/planting method. If they use sasakawa they use a bottle top as the quantity.  The other is the three seed per station and this go with the tea spoon/table spoon application ,,We used to get something like a cup in fertilizer which stipulates the amount of fertilizer to be applied on planting Station. This cup is equivalent to a table spoon or 3 tea spoons. This is also common knowledge to many that we apply a table spoon or 3 tea spoons.,We heard from agriculture extension workers that a teaspoon of NPK fertilizer is enough to make maize growth health. They also said a teaspoon of urea is enough to make maize produce strong and health fruits.,I was told by people and VAC. people say a teaspoon is equivalent to Coca-Cola bottle top. ,"The actual size of the land. We apply 1 teaspoon on one planting station. The panting stations are 30 cm apart. We apply fertilizer 3 or 4 cm apart. We learnt this from parents. If you apply more than 1 full table spoon, then crops get wilted.","Soil nutrient. This soil is is not so good so we use more fertilizer. We use a tea spoon of Urea, and table spoon of NPK instead of just using a tea shoot for both.",Size of the land. We apply handful of fertilizer till it fills up the whole field.
Have you received any training how to use the inorganic fertilizer?,No,No,No,,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No
Where did you learn how to use the inorganic fertilizer?,,,,,,We learn this when agriculture extension workers are distributing fertilizer. This happens at the chiefs court,VAC training ,,,
"Explain how you use the inorganic fertilizer (e.g. timing, distribution method)","After planting, then after two or three weeks they apply NPK. They apply NPK on each planting station. Then after another two or three station they apply CAN","Once I see that the plant is established/ready/health, I apply NPK. I use CAN when I see that the plants are flowering. I apply fertilizer between 30cm stations. When the planting stations are 45cm apart I put fertilizer close to plant. I see this in other fields.",As the factors of determining the quantity ,,"For apply NPK 3 inches from the maize seed/plant. We apply NPK once the maize has 2 leaves. We plant one seed per hole at a distance of 30 cm apart. Urea apply when we see ngayaye, and we also see that it's producing the last leaves. The other leaves faces down, but the last one we know it since it doesn't face down. When we see this we know and apply Urea. We use the same distribution method, and quantity as NPK.","We apply fertilizer 10 cm away from planting Station. When we plant 3 seeds per station, the stations are 60 meters apart. When we plant 2 seeds per station, the stations are 30 meters apart. When we have more fertilizer we apply on both sides of the plants at 10 cm apart on each side. The timing has been described before",,As explained before,We apply fertilizer 5 cm meter from the plant. We plant crops 30 cm meter apart. We simply know that this spacing is ideal for maize. We apply NPK fertilizer whennit has 3 or 4 leaves. We apply Urea when maize is about 45 cm. Our soil doesn't make grow very high - so for very good soil you apply Urea when maize is at least a meter,"We apply NPK after 2 or 3 week ,or when maize plant has 3 or 4 leaves. We apply urea when it's on the knee height. We apply fertilizer at a distance of 4 to 5 cm from the plant to avoid wilting of the maize. I learnt from my family"
Have you ever experienced issues related to the inorganic fertilizer use on your farm?,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes
Please expain what issues you have experienced:,"It wilts crops when it's applied close to the plant. When they don't have money the plants don't grow well. Overall, they like fertilizer because it's faster and grow well","I used Urea once, and tomato died. It doesn't happen with CAN and NPK","When they apply fertilizer and the rain is not falling maize wilts. When they apply the fertilizer close, the maize dries out. When you start using inorganic, you have to continue using it. If you unstoppable and use organic fertilizer maize doesn't do well",,When there is little water maize dries out. It needs more watering.,,Maize still grow poorly on one side even after applying fertilizer. Buried maize stalks in that area to improve soil,,"When you apply fertilizer very  close to the plant, it wilts.","It caused wilting of maize. People told us that we applied urea close to the plants, and some said the fertilizer was very powerful "
Do you think the usage of inorganic fertilizer can have a negative impact on your crops?,Yes,Yes,Don't know,,Yes,No,Don't know,Don't know,No,No
Why do you think so? What could be an impact?,It dry out crops when it's applied excessively and close to the planting station,"If you use it on crops it has negative impact. For example, Urea on tomatoes is not good",,,Maize that got applied with inorganic fertilizer needs a lot of inorganic fertilizer to grow health. Maize which was applied with organic fertilizer doesn't need a lot of fertizer when used as seed.,,,,,
Why do you think so?,,,,,,It's just makes crops like pumpkins and maize grow better,,,Maize grow well with inorganic fertilizer ,"Fertilizer is okay, but maybe we don't know how to use it."

But, I don't know how it's made. I just hear the word of compost.","It's piling biodegradable waste and then putting ash, manure and water. You turn the mix til, you get manure. The time it takes to make compost depends on biodegradable waste. Normally, it takes 2 months to make compost.",It's manure made by mixing leaves and other biodegradable materials. Then you wait for it to break down. I only hear it from people - and I have never seen it,"It's fertilizer that is made when a pit is dug for pulling waste like leaves, sugarcane chafe and ash. No plastic should be on it. The pit should be 1×1×1 meter. You water the waste in the pit",,"Fertilizer made of mixing inorganic fertilizer, maize bran, leaves and everything that decomposes.",It's fertizer that is made by piling animal manure and putting water on the manure over time,"Is fertilizer made by mixing maize brain and other biodegradable waste in a pit for 40 days, and using it later after breakdown as fertilizer.
